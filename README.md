__DEPRECATED__: Following a more [reliable release](https://www.notion.so/Export-as-PDF-95b4340d2d67446ab6f3002261d7c573) of the Export functionality within Notion, this tool is no longer *fully* necessary.

# notion-md-pdf

Converts pages exported from [Notion](https://notion.so) as Markdown into PDF files using the command line due to browser rendering issues.

## Rationale

Provided by default within the application, Notion's "Export -> Print as PDF" functionality only allows a single page to be _printed to PDF_ at a time. As a result, formatting issues occur in most cases (e.g. multiline code snippets) from the browser attempting to render the markup unsuccessfully.

### Process

```text
Markdown Files -> marked -> HTML Files -> wkhtmltoPDF -> PDF Files
```

The methodology used by this tool is simply to take exported Markdown pages from Notion, individually or in bulk, uncompress the downloaded archive and then process each by first parsing into HTML using [`marked`](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) and then converting to PDF using [`wkhtmltopdf`](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

**Note:** `wkhtmltopdf` is used instead of other [`PhantomJS`](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)-based methods which seem to suffer some similar defects ([#10373](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10373), [#10669](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10669), [#13524](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/13524)) as the browser, even though both are using the [QtWebKit](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit) rendering engine.

## Installation

Use your ideal package manager for Node and install globally.

Yarn

```bash
yarn global add notion-md-pdf
```

NPM

```bash
npm install notion-md-pdf -g
```

## Usage

Call the following shell command with the desired zip archive of Markdown files as the first argument.

```bash
notion-md-pdf Export-XXXXXX.zip
# Conversion completed: ~/Document-Name-XXXXXX-1.pdf
```

### Individual Markdown File Support

```bash
notion-md-pdf Document-Name-XXXXXX.md
# Conversion completed: ~/Document-Name-XXXXXX-1.pdf
```

## Supported Operating Systems

Windows (64-bit), Mac OS X (64-bit), and Linux (32-bit) (64-bit) OS are supported.

_Based on the version of `wkhtmltopdf` that is downloaded from a CDN by the post installation script._
